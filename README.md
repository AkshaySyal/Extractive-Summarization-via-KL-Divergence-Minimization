# Extractive-Summarization-via-KL-Divergence-Minimization
This project implements extractive summarization using the KL-Sum method, specifically by building summaries based on word frequency distributions (words_PD) from the source document, and evaluates the generated summaries against human gold summaries on the DUC dataset using ROUGE metrics.
